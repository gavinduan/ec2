<para>
The EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) roll is designed to enable users to 
develop and test virtual machine appliances on a local Rocks cluster 
and then easily bundle and upload the appliance as a virtual machine 
image in Amazon's EC2 Computing Cloud.  Initial Release of this Roll
supports creation of paravirtualized machines backed by S3 storage. A 
subsequent release will support building of bootable EBS volumes.  
</para>
<para> Amazon boasts "thousands of available public images," 
yet the specific contents and software versions are unknown quantities.  
Most of these available images are crafted by hand and may or may not suit your needs. Only careful and meticulous inspection will determine if these images have the software you need. Starting with an existing image that does not meet 
your needs then requires hand-configuration and rebundling. 
</para>

<para>
The goal of this Roll is to enable well-defined and repeatable machine
definitions for users who would like the descriptive power of Rocks Rolls 
to define their own custom Amazon instances. Rocks-created images can be 
tested/tuned locally and then uploaded (and published if desired) as Amazon Machine Images. 
</para>

<para>
This roll simplifies the arcane tasks of Amazon Machine Image (AMI) preparation 
and bundling.  This roll requires the Rocks Xen Roll. For a user to upload, store, and boot an image in Amazon, an account with <trademark>Amazon Web Services</trademark> is required.
</para> 

<para>
The roll does not currently enable user to build clusters inside of Amazon.
