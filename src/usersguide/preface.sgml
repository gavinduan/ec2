<para>
The EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) roll is designed to enable users to develop and test virtual 
machine appliances on a local Rocks cluster and then easily bundle and upload the appliance as a virtual machine 
image in Amazon's EC2 Computing Cloud.  
</para>
<para> Amazon boasts "thousands of available public images," yet the specific contents and 
software versions are unknown quantities.  Most of these available images are crafted 
by hand and may or may not suit your needs. Only careful and meticulous inspection will determine
if these images have the software you need. Starting with an existing image that does not meet 
your needs then requires hand-configuration and rebundling. 
</para>

<para>
The goal of this Roll is to enable well-defined and repeatable machine
definitions for users who would like the descriptive power of Rocks Rolls to define
their own custom Amazon instances. Rocks-created images can be tested/tuned locally 
and then uploaded (and published if desired) as Amazon Machine Images. 
</para>

<para>
This roll simplifies the arcane tasks of Amazon Machine Image (AMI) preparation 
and bundling.  This roll requires the Rocks Xen Roll. For a user to upload, store, and boot 
an image in Amazon, an account with <trademark>Amazon Web Services</trademark> is required.
</para> 

<para>
The roll does not currently enable user to build clusters inside of Amazon.
