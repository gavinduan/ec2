This section explains the basic steps for building an EC2 compatible appliance
</para>

<para>
The basic Steps for building and Running an EC2 VM (Hereafter called an <emphasis>AMI</emphasis> 
or Amazon Machine Image) are as follows. When starting from scratch, it takes 60 - 90  minutes
to complete all steps.

<para>
<emphasis>Kicktart a Rocks VM Appliance</emphasis>. In Rocks any appliance
(except a frontend) can be built
as a virtual machine.  EC2 supports only single ethernet interface appliances. On Local Cluster. About 10-15 minutes.
</para>

<listitem>
<para>
<emphasis>Bundle the Rocks-created VM image using Amazon Tools</emphasis>. Amazon stores disk images using their own segmented, compressed and encrypted format.  Each segment is a maximum of 10MB. The EC2 roll provides a Rocks command to complete this step. On Local Cluster. About 10-20 minutes depending on size of software.
</para>

<listitem>
<para>
<emphasis>Upload the bundle into Amazon S3</emphasis>. Rocks EC2 provides a single command to upload a bundled image into S3. Transfer from Local to Amazon. 15-60 Minutes depending on size of image and connection to Amazon.

this is a single ec2-supplied command. Can also be accomplished using Amazon's web portal.

<emphasis>Boot the AMI in Amazon</emphasis>.  This is through a single ec2-supplied command. Can also be accomplished using Amazon's web portal.
this is a single ec2-supplied command. Can also be accomplished using Amazon's web portal. 10-15 Minutes from submit to running. Dependent on Amazon internals.

<title>Using EBS base instance</title>

<para>
Amazon AWS support now provisioning of block level storage volumes for use 
within EC2 instances called EBS.
EBS volume can be of any size from 1 GB to 1 TB single or multiple partitions. 
It is possible now to have EBS backed AMI, which means that their root file 
system resides on an EBS volume.
When you use EBS backed AMI (instead of S3 backed AMI), you can 
have a the root file system of any size and deployment time is much shorter.
Although running cost are a little higer since the user has to pay for the 
EBS volume.
</para>

<para>
Rocks support the deployment of such AMI. In paragraph <xref linkend="ebs-ec2-image">
we give a short example of how to create EBS backed AMI using Rocks.
