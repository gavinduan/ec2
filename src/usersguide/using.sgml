This section explains the basic steps for building an EC2 compatible appliance

<para>
The basic Steps for building and Running an EC2 VM (Hereafter called an <emphasis>AMI</emphasis> 
or Amazon Machine Image) are as follows. When starting from scratch, it takes 60 - 90  minutes
to complete all steps.

(except a frontend) can be built

The EC2 roll provides a Rocks command to complete this step. On Local Cluster. About 10-20 minutes depending on size of software.

<title>Using EBS base instance</title>

<para>
Amazon AWS support now provisioning of block level storage volumes for use 
within EC2 instances called EBS.
EBS volume can be of any size from 1 GB to 1 TB single or multiple partitions. 
It is possible now to have EBS backed AMI, which means that their root file 
system resides on an EBS volume.
The main advantage of this approach are that the the root file system can be 
of any size and the deployment time is much shorter.
Although running cost are a little higer since the user has to pay for the 
EBS volume (above the cost of the running instance).
</para>

<para>
Rocks supports the deployment of such AMI. The basic step to deploy a EBS 
backed AMI are slightly different from the S3 backed AMI (see below).

<emphasis>Upload the machine into Amazon EBS</emphasis>. 
Rocks EC2 provides a single command to upload a disk image into an EBS volume, 
the disk image must be single partition. In this case there is no need to 
bundle the disk in the AMI format (unlike the S3 backed AMI). To transfer the 
data Rocks uses UDT protocol (<ulink url="http://udt.sourceforge.net/">http://udt.sourceforge.net/
</ulink>) which does not encript data, hence you should not use this method
if you have sensitive data on your image.
Transfer from Local to Amazon is 10-20 Minutes depending on size of the disk 
and connection to Amazon.
