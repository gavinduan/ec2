<title>Credential Directory need by EC2 Roll</title>

<para>
Amazon Web Services uses combinations of X.509 Certificates, private passwords, and 
ssh keys. All of these are needed to use Amazon Web Services. The Rocks EC2 Roll requires these
various forms of identification to be named in a particular way in a single directory. The 
default directory is ~/.ec2.  These files contain EC2 passwords and other cryptographic 
identifiers.  Unfortunately, Amazon is not consistent for when they need Public/Private X.509 and
when Secret Keys are needed. This directory should be protected from prying eyes. The contents and specific names of files in this directory are as follows:

<emphasis> Create X509 Key and Download The Keypair.</emphasis>
Amazon also uses X.509 certificates for some of their commands. In particular, a bundled
machine image is encrypted using these keys. The public key needs to be copied into
<computeroutput>~/.ec2/cert.pem</computeroutput> and  the private (encryption/decryption) key 
needs to be placed in <computeroutput>~/.ec2/pk.pem </computeroutput>.
The following screenshot shows where on the Amazon site you go to create and upload/download
these key pairs. Please note that Amazon does NOT store the private key of your keypair. You 
can use their website to generate the X.509 pair and then you must save the private key.
