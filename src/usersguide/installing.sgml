The EC2 Roll can be installed during the Frontend installation or added
to a running frontend. In either case, virtual machine containers (VM-Containers in
the KVM roll)  nodes must be (re)installed.

The EC2 Roll is added to a Frontend installation in exactly the same
manner as the required base Roll. Simply select the EC2 roll as you would 
any network- or CD-based roll.

Once the EC2 Roll is loaded the installer will continue installation
automatically with no further user input. A sample EC2-compatible appliance type
("Development Appliance") will be added, Rocks command set extensions and Amazon client commands.

In theory, any Rocks appliance can be made EC2 compatible using this Roll. However, not all
software installed on generic appliances will necessarily function properly in the EC2 network 
environment. The included Development Appliance should be used as a guide for building systems 
that can function inside of EC2 without a Rocks frontend.

<para>
The EC2 Roll can be installed on a running system. The following assumes
that roll is available in .iso form and is called "&document-rollname;.iso".

$ su - root 
# rocks add roll &document-rollname;.iso
# rocks enable roll &document-rollname;
# cd /export/rocks/install
# rocks create distro
# rocks run roll ec2 | bash
